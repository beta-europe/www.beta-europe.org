"Model European Union, also known as MEU is an international simulation conference of the European Union's legislative process, which aims to connect young people from across Europe to learn about the functioning of the EU internal and its legislative procedures. The first simulation of the European Union was held in Strasbourg in 2007 and it achieved a great success with the support of the European Parliament and the European Commission.
During the course of the week, participants discuss, debate, negotiate and try to reach a compromise on proposals. This is achieved by following precisely the same procedures that the current members of the European Union follow , in the accurate placement of the European Parliament.
As noted above, participants are divided into MPs (MEP), Ministers of the European Union Council, interpreters, journalists and lobbyists.
