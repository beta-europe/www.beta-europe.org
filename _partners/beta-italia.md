BETA Italia is the Italian branch of Bringing Europeans Together Association e.V. Founded in 2016, we already count 40 members all over Italy and Europe, focusing on the realisation of 3 Model European Union in Venice, Rome and Milan. Along with MEUs, we want to spread the principles of European citizenship among the youngsters through our project "Insegnare la cittadinanza europea", whose mission is to meet High School students and discuss the European Union, its issues and its perks.

Moreover, on our website we have also a section called "Alpha-Beta" in which our members write articles on European affairs and news related to our present and past projects across the peninsula.

We have numerous partnerships with European association with whom we share values and our motto: "Bringing Europeans Together".
