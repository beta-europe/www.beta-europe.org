Bringing Europeans Together Assocation Eesti (BETA Eesti) was established in 2017 as the Estonian national branch of Bringing Europeans Together Association e.V. The aims of the organisation are development of civic society, promoting informal education and encouraging debate between citizens and policy-makers via international youth conferences and cooperating with other organisations and associations in Estonia and abroad. As its flagship project, BETA Eesti organises the annual Model European Union Tallinn conference in Tallinn, Estonia. Model European Union Tallinn is an international political simulation for approx. 100 young people from across Europe and the neighbouring areas. MEU Tallinn traces its roots back to Europe House Tallinn 2012 and MEU Tartu 2012 conferences and since MEU Tallinn 2013 has been organised annually under its current name.
