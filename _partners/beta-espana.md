BETA España is a non-profit national youth association founded in the summer of 2011 and our primary goal is to bring young people closer the European Union and its institutions. During our main event, Model European Union Granada, we at BETA España aim to provide university students with a thorough knowledge of the decision-making process (ordinary legislative procedure) which is carried out in the EU headquarters. We strive to vividly represent the way new EU legislation comes to force while fostering mutual understanding and cooperation through debate and dialogue.
