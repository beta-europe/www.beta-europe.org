BETA Slovakia is the official organisation of BETA Europe in Slovakia, a non-profit national youth association founded in 2017. Its primary goal is to bring young people closer together, while creating a challenging learning environment about the European Union and its institutions.

Its flagship project will be Model European Union Bratislava. The project aims to promote knowledge of the decision-making process, representing the way new EU legislation comes to force while fostering mutual understanding and cooperation through debate and dialogue.
