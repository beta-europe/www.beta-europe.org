excerpt: >-
  BETA España is a Spanish non-governmental organisation promoting awareness of the European and international political system as well as youth participation and active citizenship since 2011. We are a volunteer based organisation and our work is unpaid. Our main tool is the organisation of Model European Union (MEU) conferences, which let participants discover the law and decision making of the European Union through learning by doing. Being assigned the role of a Minister in the Council of the EU or a Member of the European Parliament, they debate and amend legislative proposals being scrutinised by journalists, influenced by lobbyists, and having the deliberations simultaneously or consecutively interpreted. In 2019, we successfully organised the ninth edition of MEU Granada attracting 110 participants of 25 different nationalities. Having developed the concept of MEU over the years, we would like to further enhance it by the addition of NATO within the framework of the very first edition of MEU Spain
